# Python code snippet for NI-DAQmx (NI-6215)

This **Python** class controls the **NI-6215** USB DAQ:
* connect to the device
* read and write
* analog and digital signals

This class:
* uses the "nicaiu.dll"
* run on "MS Windows" but adaptation to Linux should be possible
* should also be easy to adapt to other NI DAQ cards
* was tested with Python 2.7 but should run with Python 3.x

This class is meant as a lightweight code to be used as a "code snippet" and not as a full package.
For more functionalities, you can use libraries like "NI-DAQmx Python".
